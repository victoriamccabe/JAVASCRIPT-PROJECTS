##  Features

### 1. Animated Header

- As you scroll down, the header **shrinks in size**, creating a subtle and elegant effect.

### 2. Interactive Car Titles
- Hovering over the car gallery triggers a **staggered slide-down animation** for each car title.  
- When the cursor leaves the area, the titles **slide up and disappear** again.

### 3. FAQ Section
- Clicking on any question reveals its answer through a **slide toggle effect**.  
- Each FAQ item operates independently, providing a clean, accordion-style interface.
